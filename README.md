# hw5_daily_planner
Making a daily planner.  

Created a planner that uses moment.js to keep track of time, and local.Storage to save the event.

I used jQuery to get creat elements for the different variables.  One in particular for the times.  Used a for loop to cycle through numbers and create elements for each.

I added elements for decription and the save btn and used the bootstrap grid method to frame it.  

wrote a simple if else statement to link to corresponding css property to change the color of the present, past, and future time blocks.  

Using parent methods, I grabbed what text from the description element, and saved to local.storage.  I used get.storage to fill the description element if something had been saved, and an or operator distinguish whether or not there was text there or to leave it blank.
